# Retire TVDB

TVDB is removed from the active dashboard, API, typed contracts, CLI work documents and
provider search. Fanart movie artwork continues to use TMDB; Fanart series artwork is retired.
AniList remains installment-owned. Existing migration history and the frozen reference website
are historical records and are not rewritten.

`packages/database/drizzle/0029_remove_tvdb.sql` removes the two columns and their unique
indexes. The migration is prepared but **not applied to the live family database**. Aqua
prioritized preserving the complete catalog over physically deleting the stored identifiers.
The live database can retain these unused nullable columns without affecting the updated code.
Do not run the migration automatically at startup.

## Verified recovery — 2026-10-08

Private, ignored backup directory: `data/backups/tvdb-removal-20261008/`.

- `catalog-before.dump`: complete custom-format PostgreSQL backup.
- `SHA256SUMS`: dump checksum.
- `title-tvdb-ids.json` and `installment-tvdb-ids.json`: preserved identifiers (five titles,
  zero installments).
- `rollback.sql`: transactional column/index recreation and restoration of those identifiers.
- `verification.json`: results of the backup restore and removal/rollback rehearsal.

The dump restored into `nahhasio_tvdb_removal_20261008_test`. All 71 public tables matched
live row counts and full content fingerprints: 223 titles and 364 installments. Removal
preserved every non-TVDB value. Rollback restored the complete original contents.
Only the isolated database received schema writes; live access was read-only.

This backup shares the laptop with the catalog. Copy it to an independent device and verify
its checksum before a future live schema cutover. If the catalog changes after this backup,
take a fresh backup and repeat the preservation rehearsal before applying the migration.
Use a fresh identifier export for rollback after subsequent edits; an old rollback file must
not overwrite newer values. Do not restore an old whole-database dump over a newer live catalog.
