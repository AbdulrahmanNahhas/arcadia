/**
 * Container-friendly `db:migrate`: the same two steps `pnpm db:migrate` runs (the media backfill
 * pass, then Drizzle's pending migrations) bundled into `dist/migrate.js` so a deployed API image
 * can migrate its own database with `node dist/migrate.js` — no repo checkout, no drizzle-kit, no
 * pnpm on the server. Never runs on API start; schema changes stay an explicit step (see
 * "Database and API safety" in CLAUDE.md and the Quadlet `arcadia-migrate` unit).
 *
 * The migrations folder is `packages/database/drizzle` in the repo and `/app/drizzle` in the image
 * (see apps/api/Dockerfile); `ARCADIA_MIGRATIONS_DIR` overrides both. Drizzle's programmatic
 * migrator and drizzle-kit share the journal and the `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` table, so a
 * database migrated by one can be continued by the other.
